JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to 
provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.

JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the 
programming language named Java.

In practice, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be 
used interchangeably—they are two names for the same language.

JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows.

In this book, I’m using the 2017 version of JavaScript.

the Node.js project (the subject of Chapter 20), provide 
an environment for programming JavaScript outside of the browser.
